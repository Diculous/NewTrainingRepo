When we were young, the future was so bright
Woah-oh
The old neighborhood was so alive
Woah-oh
And every kid on the whole damn street
Woah-oh
Was gonna make it big and not be beat
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn
Woah-oh
The kids are grown up, but their lives are worn
Woah-oh
How can one little street swallow so many lives?
Chances thrown
Nothing's free
Longing for used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives
Shattered dreams (Go!)
